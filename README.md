# REACT/REDUX FINAL PROJECT

## Real Estate Organizational Application

Welcome to my final React/Redux Project! This application endeavors to provide users with a way of organizing their real estate investments. The purpose is to have a place for easy access of documents, as well as listing of important contacts and links. Future versions may provide a way to receive rents from tenants, as well as making payments to banks and other agencies as they pertain to each property.

Users will be able to take the following actions:

1. Signup for a new account, log in and log out;
2. Add/create a building to be saved to a database;
3. Add public record documents (i.e. deeds, mortgages, etc.) as directly associated to each building;
4. Read/retrieve information about each building in the user's view;
5. Update information for each building in order to correct or modify the building's; and
6. Delete individual building entries only entries made by the user that is logged in.

## Running the Program

To use this application the way that it was intended please follow the following instructions:

1. Open this repository https://github.com/yomi413/final-react-redux-portfolio-project.git;
2. Clone or download the repository, and save it locally;
3. In the terminal, activate the API server by running the following commands;
   a. Run `bundle install`;
   b. Run `rake db:migrate`; and
   c. Run `rails s -p 3001` to start the API server.
4. In a new terminal window or tab run the following commands to activate the UI (user interface);
   a. Run `npm install`; and
   b. Run `npm start` (this command will automatically open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser).
